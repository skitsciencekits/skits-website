          <p>
            Hello! My name is Stephanie Lin and I am a junior at Whitney High School. My favorite STEM subject is biology because I find it interesting to learn about the little things inside organisms that create the world around us. I first started my experience with Skits as a student of their Stem Immersion Program, during the summer of the pandemic, before becoming involved in providing these exciting opportunities for younger students in the community. Now, as president, I am excited to see SKITS grow over the next few years!

            Hi! I'm Audrey, and my favorite STEM fields are biology and math! I've been deeply involved with Skits through the STEM Immersion Program and the in-person Science Kits sessions. I find that explaining STEM concepts to young students through hands-on projects is very rewarding, especially in communities with less access to engaging methods of learning. I look forward to expanding Skits's programs, creating meaningful connections between teachers and students, and promoting equal educational opportunities.

            My name’s Mohana, and I’m SKITS’ VP of Outreach! I’m a rising junior and I love engineering + biology. When I’m not crashing out over school or robotics, I’m usually going out for runs, doing puzzles, or hanging out with my family.

            Hi! My name is Mida and I'm a senior at Whitney High School. When I'm not doing work, I enjoy snacking and taking photos on my camera. I am so honored SKITS' Vice President of Fundraising and Marketing, since I'll be part of creating opportunities for children to access STEM! Personally, STEM is something I love and pursue both inside and outside the classroom. I hope for SKITS STEM to provide more children with oppurtunities this year!

            Hi, my name is Vishakha, and I've had a wonderful experience over the past year working with SKITS. I've been actively involved in volunteering to teach elementary students about a variety of STEM topics in engaging and creative ways.

            Hiya! I'm Chandni Chhabra, the Co-Director of STEM Immersion Programs this term :) I joined SKITS because I wanted to spread the joy of learning STEM to younger students as well as push the limits of what they might think is possible for their future. I especially hope to show the younger female students how to be ambitious and truly make their dreams a reality.

          <p>
            Hi, I'm Alicia! STEM has always been a big part of my life since I was young, and getting to learn more in hands-on experiences has been important in shaping my interest for it. This reason is why I joined SKITS, first volunteering as a teacher for the Summer Immersion Program. I got to work with others who loved STEM to teach students Python, helping me see just how important the organization could be for spreading a love for STEM. Now, as a member of SKITS Cabinet, I want to reach more students who were just like me when I was young, encouraging them to learn more about their interests and pursue them.

            Hi! I'm Alice, and I joined SKITS as a tutor and teacher's assistant in the STEM Immersion Program. I've also volunteered at the in-person Science Kits sessions. These experiences have had a lasting impact on me, and I really enjoy teaching younger students about STEM. I especially like explaining STEM concepts to help students to love STEM as much as I do. I look forward to being a part of this year's cabinet!
