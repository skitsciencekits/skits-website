      This summer, Skits’s summer immersion program offered online courses in math, coding, CAD, chess, nutrition, marine biology, medical technology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and STEM careers. These classes were open to all students grades one through six and all classes were free. High school students volunteered as teachers, teacher assistants, and tutors, helping teach younger students these different courses.</p>
      <br>

      <p>The program took place online weekly, with two sessions per day, for four weeks. This helped guide the students towards a better understanding of these various topics and prepared them well for the upcoming school year. </p>
<br>

    <p>During each session, students were encouraged to participate and stay engaged. They were able to apply what they learned immediately with fun activities and games. They were also able to interact with teachers and other students, creating a welcoming and supportive environment to learn. Students were also given optional homework to complete to help reinforce key concepts outside of class.
