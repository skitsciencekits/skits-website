    <h2>What is our STEM Camp?</h2>
    <p>
      Young students will learn about topics like exploring density, chemical reactions, and chemical bonds through hands-on labs! Students will be taught by Whitney, Cerritos, and other high school student tutors who excel in the subjects they are teaching and are qualified to teach young children.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd like your child to receive a immersive, engaging, and intellectual STEM lab experience, this is the perfect opportunity for you! It is completely FREE OF CHARGE and open to a maximum of 40 participants, so early registration is highly recommended. We hope your child can join us for this exciting experience!

    <h2>Who Can Sign Up as a Volunteer?</h2>
    <p>
      Any enthusiastic high school student that is located in or near Artesia can sign up to be a volunteer. Volunteering along with us is a great way to earn community service hours and gain valuable teaching experience!
    </p>
    <p>
      As a volunteer, you will assist the students (grades 1st to 6th) with the labs and help to ensure that the STEM camp runs smoothly. On the day of the camp, set up will be from 2:30 - 3:00, and the class will be from 3:00 - 4:00. Please make sure that you can attend for this whole time period. After the signups have closed, we will send out an official volunteer sheet, which will tell you which session you will be volunteering at. Thank you for your interest in our program. Your help is greatly appreciated!
