  <h1>Chem and Physics Camp</h1>

      This summer, Skits held an in-person chemistry and physics camp where volunteers taught students the basics of chemistry and physics. These classes were open to anyone grades one through six and all classes were free. The camp took place at Holy Family Church for two weeks. </p>
      <br>

      <p>During the first week, our volunteers taught students basic chemistry. Each day, students learned something new, formed a hypothesis, and tested it through exciting experiments. Topics included acids and bases, the pH scale, polymers and polymer chains, crosslinkers, and physical and chemical changes. They also participated in fun experiments from making a baking soda volcano to making cloud dough. They were even able to take home some of what they had made!

</p>
<br>

    <p>In the second week, our volunteers taught students basic physics. During each class, students had to apply and actively recall what was taught. There were short, fun quizzes which encouraged students to stay engaged. Every class had an activity that related to what they had learned that day. Students worked in groups to creatively build paper bridges and marshmallow catapults. Groups were also given prizes at the end if they completed a challenge successfully. At the end of the week, students were able to make and eat ice cream! 
        </p>
      
      <br>
      
      <p>These two weeks of camp helped guide the students towards a better understanding of these two subjects and prepared them well for the upcoming school year. </p>
